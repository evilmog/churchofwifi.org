  Welcome to the Church of Wifi, this site has minimal content at the moment because EvilMog is lazy.
  He will get to adding more things as he has time.

### Shenanigans (def)

* `she·​nan·​i·​gan | \ shə-ˈna-ni-gən:`

* `a devious trick used especially for an underhand purpose`

* `tricky or questionable practices or conduct —usually used in plural`

* `high-spirited or mischievous activity —usually used in plural`

### Church of Wifi Definition of Shenanigans
The Church of Wifi defines shenanigans differently.

* `Stupidity or silliness caused by not enough alcohol`

* `The true hacker spirit`

* `Doing things like dropping stuffed animals with parachutes because we can`

### Rules
The Church of Wifi has very few rules, although we are a bonafide religion we are
also compatible with other religions. We can best be defined as absurdists in that
we can never really know if life has meaning while we are alive. As a result of
being absurdists we are compatible with theistic, atheistic, absurdist and even
nhilistic belief systems.

* `Your belief system is a personal choice, we are not an evangelical church and
will not force our belief systems on others.`

* `Informed consent in all things is mandatory, as such you cannot join the church
until you are of the age of majority.`

* `Alcohol and substance free options to everything shall always be available.`

* `The shenanigans commandments shall always be upheld.`

* `The DEFCON Code of Conduct shall be strictly adhered to.`

* `Harassment of any form to any member or non member shall not be tolerated.`

### Commandments

#### Do No Harm
* The first commandment is `do no harm`, just like physicians. You do not want to get
kicked out/banned/arrested etc. We do not provide bail money for our members, anything
you do as a member of the church is really as a private citizen.

* The sub-commandment is `do not be a jerk`, and shouldn't need to be said but here we are.

* If you feel you need to cause damage, GTFO, we are a peaceful non damaging group.

* Every time you do a shenanigan put yourself on the receiving end, imagine your reaction. Is this
still a good idea, if so then proceed, if not `STOP RIGHT NOW`.

* Imagine the publics reaction to your shenanigan, is this the kind of thing that would ruin someones day.
If so stop!.

* Use shenanigans to make life a bit brighter and happier.

* Negative and harmful shenangians are called crimes.

#### DO the Math

Look we are smart here, when doing anything make sure you do your homework. A well planned shenanigan is an excellent shenanigan.

* If dropping, suspending, launching things, or other shenanigans involving gravity or force make sure you run your ballistic force
calculations and compensate for failure.

* Make sure you weigh things if dropping or suspending stuff, add a margin of error. Heavy things and gravity lead to injuries, ensure
you have parachutes or other methods to reduce harm. Make sure your parachutes are rated for the load you are dropping. Make sure the
load you drop won't hurt anybody even if the parachute fails to deploy.

* Have sober assistance to verify your math and supervise all shenanigans. The sober person should be `8 hours bottle to throttle`

* Validate escape / abort plans at multiple checkpoints, and use your checklists

* If you are going to be breaking rules, ensure that conference staff are engaged and supportive

#### Clean Up

Look we are all adults here, cleanup after your shenanigans, don't be a jerk and leave a mess for others.

* If anything untethered is launched be ready to retrieve it.

* If anything is launched be ready to lose it!

* Cleanups should be done in 10-15 minutes

* May require extra bodies, claning supplies, tools, etc, have them ready.

* Have a `DOCUMENTED` plan for cleanup you can show to conference security staff

#### Designated Adult

You should have a sober person to be the designated adult, this person has the ability to terminate
the shenanigan at any point without argument, they can also designate contingency plans to be executed
if things go sideways.

* You do not need to be drunk to enjoy a shenanigan.

* Ideas conceived while drunk or under the influence may seem like a good idea at the time, others may not
enjoy it and `beer goggles` are a thing.

* Run all plans by the sober adult, and review them yourself when sober. If the sober adult gives the OK, then
proceed carefully.

* Sober people may not enjoy your shenanigans.

* If things involve heights make sure all shenanigan operators BAC is below .04

* Double check your math by sober people and/or technical specialists.

* Do not argue with your designated adult and/or security staff.

#### Responsibility

We are all responsible adults, if we aren't we shouldn't be doing shenanigans.

* You break it you bought it, its that simple, be prepared to pay for any damage you cause.

* Plan for failure, be ready to accept resonsibility and consequences for your actions.

* Responsibility should drive the `is this a good idea` debate.

* Your shenangians may cause personal and unforseen slights and insults, you should be prepared
to accept personal emotional respnsibility for your actions. Impacts can spread beyond financial
and property.

* If you are pushing limits, be ready to get push back. Own your shenanigan and actions.

##### Property Damage
Now we will take a side tangent, property damage. Your shenanigans could cause property damage, this
is not ideal and you `MUST` make ammends. We have seen cases where people have thrown jars through car
windows or damaged venues. This is not an acceptable shenanigan.

* Do not throw jars of cherries through peopes car windows

* Do not permanently alter the venue or other peoples property without permission from the owner of said
property.

* If you break things make it right

* Do not apply stickers to walls, they are a royal pain to clean up.
