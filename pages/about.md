  Welcome to the Church of Wifi, this site has minimal content at the moment because EvilMog is lazy.
  He will get to adding more things as he has time.

### Shenanigans (def)

* `she·​nan·​i·​gan | \ shə-ˈna-ni-gən:`

* `a devious trick used especially for an underhand purpose`

* `tricky or questionable practices or conduct —usually used in plural`

* `high-spirited or mischievous activity —usually used in plural`

### Church of Wifi Definition of Shenanigans
The Church of Wifi defines shenanigans differently.

* `Stupidity or silliness caused by not enough alcohol`

* `The true hacker spirit`

* `Doing things like dropping stuffed animals with parachutes because we can`

### Rules
The Church of Wifi has very few rules, although we are a bonafide religion we are
also compatible with other religions. We can best be defined as absurdists in that
we can never really know if life has meaning while we are alive. As a result of
being absurdists we are compatible with theistic, atheistic, absurdist and even
nhilistic belief systems.

* `Your belief system is a personal choice, we are not an evangelical church and
will not force our belief systems on others.`

* `Informed consent in all things is mandatory, as such you cannot join the church
until you are of the age of majority.`

* `Alcohol and substance free options to everything shall always be available.`

* `The shenanigans commandments shall always be upheld.`

* `The DEFCON Code of Conduct shall be strictly adhered to.`

* `Harassment of any form to any member or non member shall not be tolerated.`

### Commandments

#### Do No Harm
* The first commandment is `do no harm`, just like physicians. You do not want to get
kicked out/banned/arrested etc. We do not provide bail money for our members, anything
you do as a member of the church is really as a private citizen.

* The sub-commandment is `do not be a jerk`, and shouldn't need to be said but here we are.

* If you feel you need to cause damage, GTFO, we are a peaceful non damaging group.

* Every time you do a shenanigan put yourself on the receiving end, imagine your reaction. Is this
still a good idea, if so then proceed, if not `STOP RIGHT NOW`.

* Imagine the publics reaction to your shenanigan, is this the kind of thing that would ruin someones day.
If so stop!.

* Use shenanigans to make life a bit brighter and happier.

* Negative and harmful shenangians are called crimes.
